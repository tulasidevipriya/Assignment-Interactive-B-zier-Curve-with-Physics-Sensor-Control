# Interactive Bézier Rope (iOS, Swift)
## Overview
This project implements a real-time, interactive cubic Bézier curve that behaves like a springy rope, controlled by device gyroscope input. The curve is rendered manually, with tangents and control points visualized. All math, physics, and rendering logic is implemented from scratch.
## Math & Physics
- **Cubic Bézier Curve:**
B(t) = (1-t)^3P0 + 3(1-t)^2tP1 + 3(1-t)t^2P2 + t^3P3
- P0, P3: Fixed endpoints
- P1, P2: Dynamic, respond to gyroscope
- **Tangents:**
B'(t) = 3(1-t)^2*(P1-P0) + 6(1-t)t(P2-P1) + 3t^2*(P3-P2)
- Tangents are normalized and drawn at intervals
- **Spring-Damping Physics:**
acceleration = -k * (position - target) - damping * velocity
velocity += acceleration * dt
position += velocity * dt
- k: Spring constant
- damping: Damping factor
- target: Mapped from gyroscope
## Design Choices
- All math and physics are manual (no UIBezierPath, SpriteKit, etc.)
- 60 FPS via CADisplayLink
- Organized into math, rendering, and input sections
- Responsive to device orientation
## Usage
- Run on a real iOS device (not simulator)
- Tilt the device to control the rope
- Tangents and control points are visualized
